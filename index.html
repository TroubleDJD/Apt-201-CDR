<!--First step I took was creating the index page, about, and contact pages.-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
<style>
    body {
        background-color: rgba(205, 205, 129, 0.521);     
}
    </style>

</head>
<body>
<!--Here created my first header using the largest font-->
    <h1>Home</h1>  
<!--Here I created a block because I want the buttons to be lined up and isolated on the line. I pasted this to each page and renamed appropriately.-->
    <div>
        <a href="index.html">Home</a>
        <a href="About.html">About</a>
        <a href="contact.html">Information</a>
   </div>
<!--Added image from the web and also resized using the image height tag and set for 300 pixels-->
    <img height= "300px" src="https://proksol.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/cdr-slide01.jpg"alt="A view of the building"/img>
<!--Here I used my second header with a slightly smaller size and then used the paragraph tag to add some descriptive wording.-->
